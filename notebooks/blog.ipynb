    "## Introduction\n",
    "Training machine learning models on a local machine in a notebook is a common task among data scientists.  It is the easiest way to get started, experiment and build a first working model. But for most businesses this is not a satisfying option: Today, making the most of your training data usually means to scale to gigabytes or petabytes of data, which do not easily fit into your local machine. Data is your most valuable asset and you would not want to use only small fraction of it due to technical reasons. Another problem that might occur when training a model on your local machine is putting it to use. A model that can only be used on your laptop is pretty useless. It should be available to a large group of consumers, deployed as a REST API or making batch predictions in a large data pipeline. If your model “works on your machine”, how does it get to production?\n",
    "\n",
    "Another pitfall lies in the consistency between code used to train a model and the serialized model itself. By design, a notebook is well suited for exploratory analysis and development via trial and error. For example, it is possible to jump between individual cells. It is not enforced to keep a given top-down order. This makes it difficult to check whether the code exactly matches the model fit. Fitting a model in a notebook, persisting it, change the notebook afterwards and do a git commit is not a desired workflow and might lead to non-traceable issues. In an optimal workflow, models and associated code should be kept consistent with each other in the sense that it should be possible to fit the model in a new environment again.\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate how many of the issues can be circumvented, by moving your training routine to the cloud. We use the AWS Service Sagemaker to execute a containerised training routine that will allow us to a) scale our training job to whatever sizes of training data, b) support our routines with single or multiple GPUs if needed, and c) easily deploy our model after the training has succeeded. The training and deployment routine will be written in a python script, which can easily be version controlled, and allows us to link code and model. The script is passed via the Sagemaker Python SDK to a container, running a docker image with all dependencies needed for the job. The main benefit of using Sagemaker is that instead of having to manage the infrastructure running the container, all the infrastructure management is done for you by AWS. All that is required is to make a few calls with the Python Sagemaker SDK and everything else is taken care of."

    "In this example we will be using the Palmer Penguin Dataset, which provides a suitable alternative to the frequently used Iris dataset. It contains information about various penguins. You can read more about it [here](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins/articles/intro.html). The objective we will be solving with our machine learning algorithm is predicting the sex of a penguin (male/female) by using various attributes of the penguin (e.g. flipper length, bill length, species, island) as our features.\n",

    "## Outlook\n",
    "We demonstrated how a machine learning training routine can be moved to a cloud-based execution using a dedicated container in AWS. Compared to a local workflow it provides numerous advantages, such as scalability of compute ressources (one simply has to change parameters on the SKLearn object) and reproducibility of results: training scripts can easily be versioned and training jobs automatically be triggered, allowing to connect model training and version control. Most importantly, it reduces the barrier between development and production: Deploying a trained model only requires a single method call.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the example provided here is not solving all technical hurdles of MLOps and more features are usually needed to build a mature ml-platform. Ideally, we would want to have a model registry, where we store and manage models and artifacts, an experimentation tracking platform to log all our efforts to improve the model, and perhaps also a data versioning tool. But moving your local training routine into the cloud is already a big step forward!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are also many possibilities to extend the training routine and adapt it towards specific needs: If special python libraries or dependencies are used for the algorithm, a custom docker image can be pushed to AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR) and then be used in the Sagemaker training routine. If data processing becomes more complex, one can use a processing container to decapsulate this step. Also, if the endpoint is used in production, it is advisable to develop a REST API on top of the deployed Sagemaker endpoint, allowing to better handle security constraints as well as logical heuristics and preprocessing of your API calls. And of course a model evaluation step that calculates metrics on the vaildation data set should be included, but we will dive deeper into model evalutation in one of our next blog posts. Stay tuned!"
