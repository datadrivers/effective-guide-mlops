    "## Building an end-to-end ML Pipeline with AWS Sagemaker & API\n",
    "\n",
    "This Notebook shows a basic example how to build an end-to-end machine learing pipeline on AWS by using the [AWS Sagemaker Python SDK](https://sagemaker.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). \n",
    "\n",
    "The AWS Sagemaker Components provide a service for running your python scripts in docker containers, using either AWS maintained images or custom images. Additionally the Sagemaker Python SDK implements many convenience functions for handling parameters such as instance size, IO-Handling, and deployment. They are great building blocks for scalable, consistent, reproducable ml pipelines. They can easily be orchestarated by either using an open source Workflow Tool (Airlflow, Prefect) or AWS Step Functions. They provide a perfect fit for ordinary ml workflows with medium sized datasets, tabular data. They support images for the most widely used ml frameworks, eg. scikit-learn, tensorflow and pytorch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Notebook contains both the source code for preprocessing, training and deployment, as well as the calls to the sagemaker API that are executing the jobs. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Data Processing:\n",
    "- The flow begins with a preprocessing script that uses `pandas` and `scikit-learn` to read a csv, apply transformations to the data, splits the data into train and test set, and saves the data to S3.\n",
    "- The preprocessing file will be executed with the `SKLearnProcessor`, where instance size and IO paths will be configured. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model Training & Deployment:\n",
    "- Next, another script for model training and deployment will be created. This script includes the algorithm, the training rutine, the serialization of the model, and the serving functions that will be used for model deployment.\n",
    "- This script will be executed with the `SKLearn` estimator class. When calling `fit()` on it, model training will be executed. When calling `deploy()`, the model will be deployed. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Model Serving:\n",
    "- A lmabda function is created as an intermediate layer between your sagemaker model endpoint and your REST API.\n",
    "- A REST API is configured with API Gateway. It consists of a simple `POST` method that calls the lambda function with live data as payload. The live data is passed to the enpoint and predictions are receid and returned to the caller. \n",
